# poems
Magnetic Poems using HTML5, JavaScript, node.js, Postgres and maybe some jQuery.

I'm doing this project to familiarize myself with node.js and increase the "cleanliness" of my javascript code. Previously, I primarily just trucked through javascript procedurally. Any difficult timing issues i fixed with callbacks and if it all worked then I was relieved. 

This project is to take a step back, understand javascript as a language, and attempt to utilize better conventions and produce better quality code.

I haven't decided if i'll use FireBug of Google Chrome Developer Tools to check the console. I'll probably start with one and end with the other for comparison.

The purpose of this app is to allow users to drag and drop words from a word bank into a text field allowing them to create 8 lines of string. The part I'm most interested in is saving the resulting 8 lines of strings (or poem) into a postgresql database using node.js. 

Additionally, I intend to give the user the ability to see old poems they have created by visiting different URLs. I don't intend to create a new page for each poem, rather will populate a div with the poem of their choosing based upon an http get command. 

The finished product will be viewable at:
